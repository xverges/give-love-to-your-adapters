What follows are the (decorated) notes I take while working on coding this project.

== Creating the MobileFirst Platform project from the CLI

----
>mfp create give-love-to-your-adapters
Error: Could not create MobileFirst Project.
Error: MobileFirst project names may only contain English alpha-numeric characters.
----

Oops. If I ever a write a http://yeoman.io/[Yeoman] generator do the 
boilerplate for MobileFirst Platform projects, I'll have to keep in mind
this restriction.

----
>mfp create GiveLoveToYourAdapters
A MobileFirst Project was successfully created at ...\GiveLoveToYourAdapters

>cd GiveLoveToYourAdapters
>git init
>git add .
>git commit -m "As created by mfp cli"
----

== Hi, new loveable adapter

----
>mfp add adapter loveableAdapter --type http
>git add .
>git commit -m "After mfp add adapter"
----

To the server, and beyond!

----
> mfp create-server
> mfp start
> mfp deploy
> mfp invoke loveableAdapter:getStories [\"world\"]
----

That last command is equivalent to just reaching the following URL 

----
http://localhost:10080/GiveLoveToYourAdapters/dev/invoke?adapter=loveableAdapter&procedure=getStories&parameters=["world"]
----

A `bin` directory appeared as a result of our deploy, and we needed to `.gitignore` it.

== Interlude: a backend to play with

Our loveable adapter will need a backend to interact with. I like 
http://couchdb.apache.org/[CouchDB] and I like https://cloudant.com/[Cloudant] 
(a BDaaS owned now by IBM, the company has been paying my bills for the last
20+ years). It looks like https://github.com/pouchdb/pouchdb-server[pouchdb-server] 
can make a nice and simple local CouchDB-compatible backend to play with;
or, easier to integrate with testing scripts, its main building block, 
https://github.com/pouchdb/express-pouchdb[express-pouchdb].

`a-sample-backend/server.js` creates a *PouchDB* in-memory server. It can be
executed standalone or from Grunt, with `grunt express express-keepalive`
thanks to https://github.com/blai/grunt-express[grunt-express].

== Static code analysis with JSHint

http://jshint.com[JSHint] _is a program that flags suspicious usage in programs 
written in JavaScript_. It can be http://jshint.com/install/[driven from the 
command line, from Grunt or often from your favorite editor]. You can tune
what it complains about using configuration files named `.jshintrc`, that 
affects the files in the folder and subfolders where it is placed. In the root
folder of the project, we will place a `.jshintrc` file in the project's root,
with all the options that we want to use for the JavaScript in our adapters,
our apps and our tests

ifdef::env-github[]
link:.jshintrc[.jshintrc]
endif::[]
ifndef::env-github[]
[source, json]
----
include::.jshintrc[]
----
endif::[]

But we will also want to set some settings according to the environment where
our adapters are executed. We will do it in the file `adapters/.jshintrc`:

ifdef::env-github[]
link:adapters/.jshintrc[adapters/.jshintrc]
endif::[]
ifndef::env-github[]
[source, json]
----
include::adapters/.jshintrc[]
----
endif::[]

To drive it with Grunt, we will need to install
https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-jshint[grunt-contrib-jshint]

----
npm install grunt-contrib-jshint --save
----

On the `jshint` task, we  want to make sure that `.jshintrc` files are used and
that the `Gruntfile.js` itself is being checked:

[source, javascript]
----
jshint: {
  options: {
    jshintrc: true
  },
  gruntfile: {                      // An arbitary name for the subtask
    src: [patterns.js.gruntfile]    // patterns holds most file paths
  },
----

And now, `grunt jshint` checks our adapters and our gruntfile.

== A Lego approach to building adapters

HTML Adapters need to be implemented in a single JavaScript file. This makes
reusing and testing code very hard. Just like it is common when working in the
front-end to build a single, minified, JavaScript file from several other
files, we are going to build our adapter by assembling smaller files. Lets 
forget about code reuse by copy-and-paste. 

=== Pods

From https://github.com/gmac/pods.js: _Pods.js is a tiny synchronous module 
definition and dependency management library, built around a familiar 
define/require interface._ Our adapter file will be assembled with the 
`pods.js` file itself and the modules that we will define using it:

[source, javascript]
----
var modules = modules || new Pod();

modules.define('moduleA', function() {
    return {
        ...
    };
});
modules.define('moduleB', ['moduleA'], function(moduleA) {
    function factory() {
    ...
    }
    return factory; 
});
----

=== The directory structure for the Lego pieces

----
adapterlib/
  common/
    pods.js             <1>
    ...                 <2>
  loveableAdapter/
    ...                 <3>
    exports.js          <4>
----

The files are numbered according to the order used to include them. 
`grunt concat` http://stackoverflow.com/q/17009874/239408[is
configured dynamically] to assemble an adapter for every subdir
in `adapterlib`.

In the common directory, I have placed a sample `logger.js` that has
some logging goodies. It can be used from other modules with
`modules.require('logger').log('bla bla')`.

I also tried to include a module to detect if we are running in a
development server or a real server... 
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/29018412/how-to-know-if-an-adapter-is-running-on-mobilefirst-development-server#comment47697093_29018506[and I failed]

`exports.js` is where you place

* `modules.require` statements that trigger the inclusion of all the modules that your
  adapter needs
* the functions that your adapter exports in its xml definition file

=== Assembling and deploying an adapter

----
>start mfp run

>cd adapters
>grunt concat & mfp build & mfp deploy

>mfp invoke loveableAdapter:getStories [\"sport\"]
----


== I thought I was getting no love from the server

=== deploy != build

I assumed that `mfp deploy` on the adapters folder would build and
deploy it. Wrong: you need to `mfp build` it before. It is a good idea
to always deploy using the debug flag (`mfp deploy --debug`), because it will
tell you if it has not updated the code in the server

=== Enable logging

`mfp create` creates a development server with logging disabled. Not what I
wanted. You need to edit its `server.xml` file and change the level from
`AUDIT` to (probably) `INFO`:

[source, xml]
----
<logging consoleLogLevel="INFO" copySystemStreams="false"/>
----

To find `server.xml`, the command `mfp logs` will help, because it outputs 
the path of directory where logs are located; the server conbfiguration files
are in its parent folder.

=== console.log is not to be trusted

The logs directory (use `mfp logs` to locate it) contains a `console.log` 
that is the main file to take care of. Well, I've seen the server happily ignore
it.

What seems to work is, rather than using `mfp start` and checking the log files,
running the server synchronosuly with `mfp run` and inspect its output.

== Keeping Eclipse happy

If Eclipse tries to process our node_modules, it will get very upset. We have
to prevent the `node_modules` and the `a-sample-backend`` from being checked
by Eclipse, so we need to exclude them in the Resource Filters dialog so
we don't waste memory and CPU cycles in some unneeded task

== Unit tests for the adapter chuncks

Our adapter's code will be running in a Rhino environment, but, for simplicity
and available tooling, we are going to use for our testing either a headless
browser environment or a node.js environment. I want to use
http://jasmine.github.io/[Jasmine] as the testing framework, and there are
Grunt plugins for both approaches:
https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-jasmine runs in a PhantomJS
environment, and  https://github.com/tepez/grunt-jasmine-npm runs in a node.js
environment.

The second approach is probably faster and simpler. However, since later on
we will also want to test client JavaScript (intended to be executed in a
browser environment), using PhantomJS for both environments reduces complexity.

=== The directory structure for our specs

----
tests/js/
    adapterlib/
        common/                     <1>
            loggerSpec.js
            ...
        loveableAdater/             <2>
            ...
    libs/
        wl.server-side.dummy.js     <3>
----
<1> holds the specs for the code that is shared by different adapters.
<2> each adapter has its own directory. 
<3> defines a double for the parts of the `WL` api used by our code; we can replace its behaviour using Jasmine's `spyOn`.

== Building for different purposes

Having different builds for different environments is a common approach,
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/420343/separate-debug-and-release-builds[even 
if controversial]. I'll use Grunt to have two different builds for our adapter:
a regular `release` build, intended for production, and a `solo` build, intended
for being used only in the developer's workstation, using a local back-end and
exposing adapter procedures without proper security settings.

I have defined the possible environments in an `envs` variable in the Gruntfile,
initialized with `['release', 'solo']`. `envs[0]` is the default environment.

`build:solo` will build for my local environment.

=== A different loveableAdapter.xml for different needs

The build task may overwrite the `adapters/adapterName/adapterName.xml` file
with a file in the `adapterlib` subfolders, where you can place xml files
specific for a given build environment, or an xml file to be used as a default.

* when building environment `foo`, if the file
`adapterlib/adapterName/adapterName_foo.xml` exists, it is used.
* otherwise, if the file `adapterlib/adapterName/adapterName.xml` exists,
it is used.
* otherwise, nothing is done. This is only a good option if you do not
customize this adapter for any of your build environments. Otherwise,
you could be using the xml from a previous build for a different environment.
